# Data analysis of Stack Overflow's developer survey data from 2020


## Project Motivation

This project is intended for confused developers (such as myself!) who have many **What, When and How** questions. It will attempt to help them make infromed decisions regarding their education and career. All my finding are published in the [Confusion of a Developer](https://medium.com) medium post.

## Analysis Findings
 1. We compiled our expectations for advancements in the software development technologies. We identified which technologies still have people's attention and which ones we should steer away from.
Looked at the importance of education on the developers future and the best timeframe to enter the field.   2. We found that BS and MS degrees in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or Software Engineering are the best options for developers.
 3. We looked at the patterns in developers actions and decision making. This provided beneficial information such as the importance of learning new technology at least once a year, benefit of using Stack Overflow when facing obstacles in addition to other situations developers might have.
